<h1>Must Haves</h1>

<p>
<ol>
    <li/>Boolean - using 2 of 3 logical operators (&&/||/!)
    <li/>Loops - use at least a "while" and a "for" loop
    <li/>Arrays - loop over and perform math or logical function on the items in the array
    <li/>Functions - requires 5 functions and then the 4 that return value should have something cool done with them
        <ul>
            <li/>doesn't return a value (procedure)
            <li/>takes 2 arguments, boolean comparison, data type doesn't matter
            <li/>takes 2 strings and does something intresting with them (can be as simple as concatenation)
            <li/>takes 1 single number and does a while loop using math at some point (like counting, summing, subtracting)
            <li/>takes an array and a number and uses a for loop (make this something interesting and not just looking up a value with the number "[3]")
        </ul>
    <li/>Arguments - make sure that you are calling the required arguments for the various items above
</ol>

<h3>Story Example</h3>

<p>Our new crewmember var crewName = "Wesley"; had only been at sea for var daysSailing = 8; days, but he was already rethinking his decision to become a pirate. All he had done so far was swab the decks = [ "Bridge", "Gun deck", "Main deck", "Quarterdeck" ];, which didn't feel very Pirate-y. It felt like his days were just the same thing over and over again:</p>

<p>Is it time to var swabTheDecks = function(decks){...};? It looks like I have var decksRemaining = decks.length; to go. The First Mate says I have to keep swabbing while (decksRemaining > 0), so I guess I'd better get to it.</p>

<p>And just like each day was the same, each deck was the same, so that for (var deckNumber = 0; deckNumber < decks.length; deckNumber++) every deck that he was told to do, he just swabbed and swabbed and swabbed. No matter who he complainTo = function(person,rant){...};, the result was always the same: return "Get back to work, " + crewName;.</p>

<p>In time, he kept his mind occupied by imagining what would happen if (ninjas.decideToAttack()) in the middle of the night.</p>
