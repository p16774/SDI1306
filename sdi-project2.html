<article>
<p>I decided to change my story to better handle the possible solutions. My first story was a bit limited in the outcomes it could provide.</p>
<p>I wrote the story first and then built in the various functions to fit the ideas I wanted to present. I felt this made it easier to code knowing what I wanted as an outcome to start then building the code to make it turn out that way.</p>
<p>All elements should have been replaced.</p>
