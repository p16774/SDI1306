<h1>Must Haves</h1>

<p>
1. Boolean - using 2 of 3 logical operators (&&/||/!)
2. Loops - use at least a "while" and a "for" loop
3. Arrays - loop over and perform math or logical function on the items in the array
4. Functions - requires 5 functions and then the 4 that return value should have something cool done with them
	a. doesn't return a value (procedure)
    b. takes 2 arguments, boolean comparison, data type doesn't matter
    c. takes 2 strings and does something intresting with them (can be as simple as concatenation)
    d. takes 1 single number and does a while loop using math at some point (like counting, summing, subtracting)
    e. takes an array and a number and uses a for loop (make this something interesting and not just looking up a value with the number "[3]")
5. Arguments - make sure that you are calling the required arguments for the various items above
